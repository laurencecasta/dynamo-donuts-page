# Dynamo Donuts Landing Page

This project is a landing page for an imaginary donut shop. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of utlizing modules. The packaging of the modules is made possible by the use of Webpack. Specifically, the I have created a module to render each page when the user clicks on the link to the page (e.g. about, menu, etc.). Because this is all in the front end, when a module renders a page, there is no reloading of the page. The navigation bar and footer stay the same and only the main content of the page changes rapidly for a better user experience.
